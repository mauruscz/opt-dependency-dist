If you want to replicate the experiments, execute the main files _drab.py_ and _mur.py_ 
By executing these you can respectively create the treebanks for all the books by Iris Murdoch and Margaret Drabble.
The execution requires some hours to be runned, this is way we keep two different files.
If you want to analyze the treebanks without re-executing calculations, you can find them in the folders _treebanks-drab.py_ and _treebaks-mur.py_
